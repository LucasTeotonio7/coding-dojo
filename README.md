# 🥋 Coding Dojo

Welcome to the **Coding Dojo**!  
This is where I train my logic, algorithms, and problem-solving skills in **Python**.  
Each challenge is like a *kata*: repetition, practice, and constant improvement.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Keep the mind sharp with coding challenges.  
- Revisit old problems to see progress in my solutions.  
- Explore Python tricks and clean coding practices.  
- Have fun while practicing 🤓  

---

## ⏱ Challenge Tracking
- Each challenge includes the **time I took to solve it**.  
- This serves as a personal record to measure my evolution.  
- If I redo a challenge, I create a **v2** (or v3, v4...) to compare with the previous attempts.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- [ ] Add the first set of Python challenges.  
- [ ] Start recording solving times.  
- [ ] Create new versions (v2, v3...) when redoing challenges.
